# Cursor Website Clone

### [Live Demo Link]

## Project Overview
This is a desktop-first clone of the **Cursor.com** landing page. I built this for the **Web Dev Cohort 2026** using only pure HTML and CSS to practice layout accuracy and visual hierarchy without using any frameworks.

## Recreated Sections
I have successfully implemented all **11 required sections**:
* **Header & Hero:** Navbar and the main intro with the large product image.
* **Feature Blocks:** Three sections with alternating text and images.
* **Grids & Cards:** Feature card grid, testimonials, and use case cards.
* **Company Info:** Trusted logos, changelog list, and the team section.
* **Footer:** Final call-to-action and the full site footer.

## Technical Details
* **Pure HTML/CSS:** No Tailwind, JavaScript were used.
* **Typography:** Used the **Inter** font from Google Fonts to match the original look.
* **Layout:** Used **Flexbox** for simple alignments and **CSS Grid** for the complex card sections.
